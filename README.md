### Learn to create a typescript project:

-   create a package.json
-   install typescript as a dev dependency
-   initialize the ts compiler tsc to create a tsconfig.json file
-   install jest, @types/jest and ts-jest

## Data Structures

### Linked List

Rather than having a list stored in contiguous memory each node in the list points to its next and/ or previous node,
with the exception of the first node (the head) and the last node (the tail).

Singly Linked List and Doubly Linked List

Linked list operations:

-   prepend / append - O(1)
-   insert at - traversal first and than O(1)
-   deletion from ends - O(1)
-   delete at - first we have to walk the list - traversal first than O(1)
-   get head / tail - if we store them O(1)
-   get
